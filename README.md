# Fan-C Face Frontalization

This repository contains the original implementation of the face normalization method Fan-C descibed in the following paper.
Please cite the paper if you use this code and/or our trained models.

In the paper the method is called "FaNC", but we like to pronounce it as "fancy" and that is why we prefer to write it as "Fan-C" now.
The acronym stands for "**Fa**ce **N**ormalization based on Learning **C**orrespondences".
The key idea is to predict coordinates and visibilities of correspondence points from facial landmarks in both the arbitrary-pose source domain and the frontal target domain.
The predicted information is used to generate a face image that is normalized regarding pose and facial proportions.
FaN-C can be learned and applied on top of any landmark localizer, also without facial contour landmarks, and is very fast.
With our unpublished OpenGL implementation it runs in less than 2 ms even on old and cheap on-board GPUs.

## Requirements

To run the code you need:

- Matlab (tested with 2014a and some newer versions)
- Our SyLaFaN dataset and/or our pre-trained models

## Getting started

**Caution: Please note that the SyLaFaN dataset and our pre-trained models are only available for non-commercial research purposes, because they are based on a non-commercial academic licence of ["FaceGen"](https://facegen.com/).**

1. Download/unpack or clone this repository
2. Download the ["SyLaFaN Dataset"](http://wasd.urz.uni-magdeburg.de/pwerner/fan-c/DB_SyLaFaN.zip)
3. Download the ["pre-trained Fan-C models"](http://wasd.urz.uni-magdeburg.de/pwerner/fan-c/fan-c-models.zip)
4. Extract the contents of the ZIP files into the root directory of this repository
5. Run the scripts in the root directory

## Note

**More code will be added soon.**
