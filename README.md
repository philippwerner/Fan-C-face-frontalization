This repository contains the original implementation of the face normalization method Fan-C descibed in the following paper.
Please cite the paper if you use this code and/or our trained models.

In the paper the method is called "FaNC", but we like to pronounce it as "fancy" and that is why we prefer to write it as "Fan-C" now.
The acronym stands for "**Fa**ce **N**ormalization based on Learning **C**orrespondences".
